    "# Practical Project: a working randomness generation with Shot Noise RNG\n",
    "\n",
    "Hi all ! My last Pratical Project was about generating key-pair for RSA and for that, I used the urandom RNG for our random source. As I told you, with time we can improved the project by adding more self-made algorithm and this why we are going to create our own RNG ! \n",
    "Disclaimer: we here for learning and train ourself, this RNG isn't cryptographically secure !\n",
