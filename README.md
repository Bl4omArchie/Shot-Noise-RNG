# Shot Noise RNG

I'm testing several RNG and PRNG algorithms. I also made a script for picture encryption with AES. 



# üöß TODO
- Fortuna, Generator and Accumulator classes
- iterate_counter() algorithm
- improve my RNG stream 

## ‚úÖ Done:
- aes picture encryption
- camera byte stream for rng source

# ‚¨áÔ∏è Installation

Should work for every python3 version.
Launch this command:
```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Then you can use the [main.py](main.py) and call my scripts.
